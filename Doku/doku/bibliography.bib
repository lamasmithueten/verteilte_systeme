	abstract = {Recently, modular monolith architecture has attracted the attention of practitioners, as Google proposed a "Service Weaver" framework to enable developers to write applications as modular monolithic and deploy them as a set of microservices. Google considered it a framework with the best of both worlds, and it seems to be a trend in software architecture. This paper aims to understand the definition of the modular monolith in industry and investigate frameworks and cases building modular monolith architecture. We conducted a systematic grey literature review, and the results show that modular monolith combines the advantages of monoliths with microservices. We found three frameworks and four cases of building modular monolith architecture. In general, the modular monolith is an alternative way to microservices, and it also could be a previous step before systems migrate to microservices.},

	abstract = {Containerization is revolutionizing the way that many industries operate, provisioning major impact to modern computing technologies because it is extra lightweight, highly portable, energy, resource and storage efficient, cost-effective, performance efficient, and extremely quick during boot up. These often facilitate efficient load balancing, low-level system maintenance, server consolidation (for efficient energy and resource utilization) and replication of instances over geographical locations for better fault tolerance to escalate application reliability. However, some recent literature have addressed various challenges (such as complex networking, persistent storage facilities, cross data centers and multicloud supports, security issues, and lack of available, capable container management {APIs}, etc.) regarding successful container adoption in industries, which might have resulted in a seemingly meager increase in industrial deployments of containerization over the past few years despite bestowing efficient lightweight virtualization. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of containerizations along with their popularity dynamics has still not been found in contemporary literature, which further extends knowledge gap between developers and available technologies. Hence, current study touches upon different technicalities involved in containerization with potential problems and possible solutions along with various important industrial applications to manifest its existing supports and technical hardships. Finally, we have conducted a comprehensive experimental study to compare the performance of {VMs}, containers and unikernels in terms of {CPU} utilization, memory footprints, network bandwidth, execution time and technological maturity using standard benchmarks and observed containers to deliver satisfactory performance in almost all aspects, however, are still not free from issues regarding isolation \& security, performance stability, lack of available efficient tools for crossplatform support and persistent storage. Unikernels deliver good performance with {VM}-like isolation but still need to achieve desired technical maturity (in terms of microprocessor stability, process containment, persistent storage, etc.). {VMs}, on the other hand, are found to provide stable performance throughout, though bigger memory footprints and slower spin up/down remain their biggest weaknesses.},
